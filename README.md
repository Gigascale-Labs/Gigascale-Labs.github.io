# Gigascale Laboratories website

Forked from the Academic Pages template on GitHub.

## Excluding files from the build

To prevent a file from being included in the Jekyll build output, add its filename to the `exclude` list in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
exclude:
  - YOUR_FILE.md
```

Files starting with `_` are automatically excluded by Jekyll without needing a config entry.

## Running locally

When you are initially working on your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.

### Using a different IDE
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed
    
    On most Linux distribution and [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) the command is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
    ```
    If you see error `Unable to locate package ruby-bundler`, `Unable to locate package nodejs `, run the following:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    then try run `sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs` again.

    On MacOS the commands are:
    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    brew install node
    gem install bundler
    ```
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.

    If you see file permission error like `Fetching bundler-2.6.3.gem ERROR:  While executing gem (Gem::FilePermissionError) You don't have write permissions for the /var/lib/gems/3.2.0 directory.` or `Bundler::PermissionError: There was an error while trying to write to /usr/local/bin.`
    Install Gems Locally (Recommended):
    ```bash
    bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
    ```
    then try run `bundle install` again. If succeeded, you should see a folder called `vendor` and `.bundle`.

1. Run `jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change to Markdown (*.md) and HTML files, while changes to the core template and configuration (i.e., `_config.yml`) will require stopping and restarting Jekyll.
    You may also try `bundle exec jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to ensure jekyll to use specific dependencies on your own local machine.

If you are running on Linux it may be necessary to install some additional dependencies prior to being able to run locally: `sudo apt install build-essential gcc make`

## Using Docker

Working from a different OS, or just want to avoid installing dependencies? You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a container that will run the site for you if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

You can build and execute the container by running the following command in the repository:

```bash
chmod -R 777 .
docker compose up
```

You should now be able to access the website from `localhost:4000`.

### Using the DevContainer in VS Code

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you can use the [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) that comes with this Repository. Normally VS Code detects that a development container configuration is available and asks you if you want to use the container. If this doesn't happen you can manually start the container by **F1->DevContainer: Reopen in Container**. This restarts your VS Code in the container and automatically hosts your academic page locally on http://localhost:4000. All changes will be updated live to that page after a few seconds.

# Writing a Blog Post

1. Create a new file in the `_posts/` directory named `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`, where the date matches your intended publish date.

2. Add the following front matter at the top of the file:

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: 'Your Post Title'
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    permalink: /posts/YYYY/MM/your-title/
    authors: ["Author Key", "Another Author Key"]
    tags:
      - tag1
      - tag2
    ---
    ```

    - `authors` must match keys defined in `_data/authors.yml` exactly. If omitted, the post will show the site-level author (Gigascale Laboratories).
    - `tags` are optional but will appear on the post and tag archive pages.
    - `permalink` should match the date and slug in your filename.

    Other valid headers are contained in FRONTMATTER_SCHEMA, which can be rendered as markdown.

3. Write your post content in Markdown below the closing `---`.

4. To add a new author, add an entry to `_data/authors.yml`:

    ```yaml
    Firstname Lastname:
      name        : "Firstname Lastname"
      bio         : "A short bio."
      avatar      : "logo.png"   # filename from /images/, or a full URL
      email       : "email@example.com"
      github      : "username"
    ```

5. Commit and push your changes. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and publish the site.

## Pulling branding updates from the template

This repo is used as a GitHub template. Repos created from it don't have an automatic link back, but you can pull in branding updates (layouts, styles, includes) manually by adding the template as an upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Gigascale-Labs/gigascale-pages-format.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

You will likely see merge conflicts in files you've customised (e.g. `_config.yml`, `_posts/`). Keep your versions of those and accept the upstream changes for branding files (`_sass/`, `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `assets/`). Once resolved:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: merge branding updates from template"
```

# Maintenance

Bug reports and feature requests to the template should be [submitted via GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/new/choose). For questions concerning how to style the template, please feel free to start a [new discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions).

This repository was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md). It is currently being maintained by [Robert Zupko](https://github.com/rjzupkoii) and additional maintainers would be welcomed.

## Bugfixes and enhancements

If you have bugfixes and enhancements that you would like to submit as a pull request, you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository as opposed to using it as a template. This will also allow you to [synchronize your copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) of template to your fork as well.

Unfortunately, one logistical issue with a template theme like Academic Pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you use this template and customize it, you will probably get merge conflicts if you attempt to synchronize, although [rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) the changes from this template will work along with manually [cherry picking](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) the relevant commits. If you are not comfortable with the Git command line, you can save your various `.yml` configuration files and Markdown files, delete the repository, and fork it again.
